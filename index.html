<p class="al">My name is Slawomir. I was born 40 years ago in Poland. In June 1997,
    I passed a secondary school final exam (specialization: general electronic engineering).
    In June 2002, I was graduated from Agricultural University (University of Life Sciences) in Lublin (Poland),
    the degree of Master of Science, Engineer.
    In 2002 I started my first job in Poland as a computer service technician. Three years later,
    I decided to move to Scotland. I wanted to improve my English and travel around the world.
    I started my working career in Scotland with simple jobs as a waiter, commis chef, handyman.
    I have been employed by Zot Engineering since November 2007. I started to work as a pcb operator.
    Five years later, I was promoted to a process engineer position. My job was to solve all technical
    issues during pcb (printed circuit board) production in the surface finish department.
    Currently, I am employed as a quality technician and I work for the same company.
